# TurbinePE Servers Backup Repository

## What does that mean?
All of the permanant stuff is here. That includes, spawn world, adventure maps, plugins, bin files, start files, software config files, and more.
<br><br>
While this might make the process more complicated, it prevents more possible errors and adds backups for if the original script fails.
<br><br>
In addition, this will make it much easier to edit and update plugins, as they will be in src form with devtools etc, making it easier to update through github.
<br><br>
It's foolproof... Except for possible leaks ðŸ˜‰
